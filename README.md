# PonderingPlus StationAPI Edition for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3

A b1.7.3 mod using StationAPI and babric (beta fabric) that was inspired by a desire to sit and read books and a love for libraries.
* Mod works on Multiplayer with [GlassConfigAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/glass-config-api) version 3.0+ used to sync configs!

## List of changes

* Added the ability to sit by right-clicking any normal block with a book
  * Optionally you can disable sitting on the book using the config provided by [GlassConfigAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/glass-config-api)
  * Use the sneak key to stand back up
  * If you log out and log back in while sitting you will fall into the block you sat on
    * To fix this, install either [AnnoyanceFix-StationAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/annoyancefix-stationapi-edition) or [UniTweaksTelsAddons](https://modrinth.com/mod/unitweakstelsaddons-stationapi) and enable vehicle logout/login fixes
* Added the ability to write a message into a bookshelf (this will convert it into a modded block type)
  * Right-click a bookshelf with a feather in hand and black dye (ink sacs) in your inventory
    * One black dye (ink sac) will be consumed and the block will convert into an editable bookshelf
  * Editable bookshelves do not catch on fire, take slightly longer to break, and show a message when right-clicked
    * Editable bookshelves drop regular bookshelves when broken and the written data is lost
    * Their texture is also reversed to distinguish them from normal bookshelves (they will still use the bookshelf texture from terrain.png)
    * The particles are also ever so slightly different as they pull from the side texture rather than top texture
  * Once a bookshelf has become editable, you can edit it any number of times without consuming further items
    * Right-click the bookshelf (item in hand does not matter) to read/edit the bookshelf message
